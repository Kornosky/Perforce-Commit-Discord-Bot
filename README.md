# PerforceCommitDiscordBot_BAT_Files
 In addition to the wonderful code written to make this bot, I made the installation process more straightforward and simple.
 
Ready to get that pesky Perforce more integrated with your usual apps? Sure you are!

-------------------------------------------
1. Place the files in your directory of choice. (This will be where the bot is installed. It's only 796 KB.)

2. Simply run the PerforceCommitDiscordBot_Installer.exe as admin (Right click -> Run as administrator)

3. Enter your discord Webhook URL. You can find that by:
going to your desired text channel -> settings/Edit channel -> Integrations -> Create Webhook -> Copy Webhook URL

3.5 Feel free to spice up your bot with a picture and a relevant name on this screen as well. 

4. Paste the Webhook URL into the Windows Command window that is open and prompting you for your Webhook URL. 

5. The Window will close and then you simply run the PerforceCommitDiscordBot.exe! 

-------------------------------------------

NOTE: The bot will only be active as long as you keep the PerforceCommitDiscordBot.exe command window open! If you like to turn off your computer then you can also add it as a program that activates on startup.
